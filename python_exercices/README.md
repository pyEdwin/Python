#### Exercice 1

* we'll be writing a small script that converts temperatures from     Fahrenheit to Celsius. 
#### Exercice 2

* Printing individual characters from the message.
* Slicing the message.
* Reversing the entire message.

#### Exercice 3

* Creating the user list and adding items.
* Removing an user and reversing the list.
* Inserting an user and combining lists.
* Slicing the list

#### Exercice 4

* The print_todo function needs to print out a string that uses the name and body values from a dictionary. To do this, we can utilize the print function and an f-string (using Python 3.6 and higher).
* The take_first function needs to return two objects to us, in the form of the first todo and the remaining todos. We can achieve this by returning a tuple of values, and the pop function on a list should allow us to get the first item.
* The sum_points function needs to receive two todo dictionaries and return the sum of the point values. The doctest shows the point values will be strings, so we'll need to convert them to be integers before we perform our addition.
